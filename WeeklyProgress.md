### Week 1 (14 Sep - 18 Sep)
This week we were busy with our TIP thus no work was done

### Week 2 (21 Sep - 25 Sep)
This week we interviewed the workshop technicians in the workshop w1218. We interviewed Mr Ang Boon Thiam and Mr Edward. Mr Edward said that he does not find the fastener dispenser useful as he prefers to just take the fasteners manually as it is faster. Mr Ang also did not really find the fastener dispenser useful, coming from the perspective of the workshop technicians as they do not really need such a machine.They do not really work on assembly drawings and thus do not find much use on the special feature our original idea for the dispenser which is to to be able to scan a standard part list for fasteners and dispensing all in one go. He however suggested that we made a fastener sorter instead as he actually has a box full of mixed up fasteners.
