### Week 1 (14 Sep - 18 Sep)

This week we were busy with our TIP thus no work was done

### Week 2 (21 Sep - 25 Sep)

This week we interviewed the workshop technicians in the workshop w1218. We interviewed Mr Ang Boon Thiam and Mr Edward. Mr Edward said that he does not find the fastener dispenser useful as he prefers to just take the fasteners manually as it is faster. Mr Ang also did not really find the fastener dispenser useful, coming from the perspective of the workshop technicians as they do not really need such a machine.They do not really work on assembly drawings and thus do not find much use on the special feature our original idea for the dispenser which is to to be able to scan a standard part list for fasteners and dispensing all in one go. He however suggested that we make a fastener sorter instead as he actually has a box full of mixed up fasteners.

Our group did further research on the fastener dispensers. We realised that such a system is rare. Rare as in multiple fasteners dispenser systems.The machines we saw could only dispense a single type of fastener. We realised that having a multiple fastener dispensing system is not practical as it would eat up huge space as the mechanical components to dispense each fastener is complex.This would also mean a limited fastener types.In conclusion, we realised that the fastener sorter is the logical idea to pursue as it is something that will be useful to the workshop and will not take up a lot of space.

For fastener sorters, we wanted to make one suited for the given box, which was a mix of different fasteners of different sizes. We researched existing products and products that had a function of sorting. Most of the machines have a limited sorting capability, for example, they sort only 1 type of fastener of different sizes.The one below can seperate by different thread size, but have the same head.It is important to note that the box of fasteners Mr Ang showed us has male parts of differing heads.

Current existing fastener sorters in the market are quite expensive and large.The machines are technologically complex, for example using complex object recognition technology by means of precision cameras to measure and identify thread diameters and the head shape of the fasteners.Our teams do not have any prior experience in this.

Our team decided that we want to make a fastener sorter that is inexpensive and compact. To do this, we will incorporate existing low technology ideas to seperate the male and female parts.To further seperate the male parts of different threads, we plan to use laser rangefinder technology to measure and identify the threads based on different distances.Below is a link to our idea we trying to in corporate

Tze Pin researched on the electrical components……..

### Week 3 (28 Sep - 2 Oct)

This week we measured the fasteners in the box and created concept sketches. We measured the outer diameter and thread diameter of a handful of male fasteners.We wanted to find out what are the sizes of the fasteners in the box so that we know the dimensions to use when designing the fastener sorter. We put inserted the values in microsoft excel to visualise the frequency of the type of fasteners.Below you can see the 3 distinct colours shades indicating the 3 distinct ranges of outer diameter of the male fasteners

Our team decided that the sorter would have two phases. The first phase is to sort the large male, small male and female parts. The second phase is to sort the male parts based on their thread diameters. From this we came up with concepts. Below is a concept for the first phase which we drew inspiration from one of our research. This method is quite a simple and low cost gravity assisted sorter, where a few walls with deviating height tolerances catches different sized male fasteners based on the outer diameter of the screws, with the thin washers being able to pass through all the walls.

We chose this because it was a simple mechanism to fabricate and we believed it would be quite precise and reliable. We further developed this concept. We realised that one of the conditions we had to work on is the speed of loading the fasteners. This is because if the fasteners entered too fast, jamming would occur. So Jeren was tasked with making the entrance for the fastener sorter. Faaris worked on the actual sorting part of the sorter, and Tze Pin worked on the vibration module of the sorter. The vibration module is required as it unjams them and helps them move as well.

For the entrance, we decide to use a coil. The coil would be able to separate the fasteners into smaller groups and push them into the sorter, allowing them to enter at a slower and constant speed, leading to less jamming occurring. Additional parts required are a tube that holds the coil, covers for both sides of the tube, a box for the user to load the fasteners and something to hole the box in place.

How this works:
After sorting the male and female fasteners at stage 1, the male fasteners will travel to stage 2, where they will be sorted by thread diameter. The fasteners will be lined up and travel in a sigle file line. They will then reach the revolver part, where the fasteners will be loaded one by one, as seen on the top view. The part will then rotate and arrive at the measuring area. A block will grip onto the thread using the tension of a tension band, then a laser range finder will measure the distance away from the block, then it will get the difference, allowing us to determine the thread diameter. ...


Jeren continued working on the entrance for the fasteners, he started working on CAD models for all the parts for the entrance. We thought that the entrance could work as an lift to carry the fasteners upwards as well. These are the models created.
