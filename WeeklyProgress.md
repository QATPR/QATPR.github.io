### Week 1 (14 Sep - 18 Sep)

This week we were busy with our TIP thus no work was done

### Week 2 (21 Sep - 25 Sep)

This week we interviewed the workshop technicians in the workshop w1218. We interviewed Mr Ang Boon Thiam and Mr Edward. Mr Edward said that he does not find the fastener dispenser useful as he prefers to just take the fasteners manually as it is faster. Mr Ang also did not really find the fastener dispenser useful, coming from the perspective of the workshop technicians as they do not really need such a machine.They do not really work on assembly drawings and thus do not find much use on the special feature our original idea for the dispenser which is to to be able to scan a standard part list for fasteners and dispensing all in one go. He however suggested that we make a fastener sorter instead as he actually has a box full of mixed up fasteners.

Our group did further research on the fastener dispensers. We realised that such a system is rare. Rare as in multiple fasteners dispenser systems.The machines we saw could only dispense a single type of fastener. We realised that having a multiple fastener dispensing system is not practical as it would eat up huge space as the mechanical components to dispense each fastener is complex.This would also mean a limited fastener types.In conclusion, we realised that the fastener sorter is the logical idea to pursue as it is something that will be useful to the workshop and will not take up a lot of space.

For fastener sorters, we wanted to make one suited for the given box, which was a mix of different fasteners of different sizes. We researched existing products and products that had a function of sorting. Most of the machines have a limited sorting capability, for example, they sort only 1 type of fastener of different sizes.

Current existing fastener sorters in the market are quite expensive and large.The machines are technologically complex, for example using complex object recognition technology by means of precision cameras to measure and identify thread diameters and the head shape of the fasteners.Our teams do not have any prior experience in this.

Our team decided that we want to make a fastener sorter that is inexpensive and compact. To do this, we will incorporate existing low technology ideas to seperate the male and female parts.To further seperate the male parts of different threads, we plan to use laser rangefinder technology to measure and identify the threads based on different distances.Below is a link to our idea we trying to in corporate
