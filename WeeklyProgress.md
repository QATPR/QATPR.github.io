### Week 1 (14 Sep - 18 Sep)

This week we were busy with our TIP thus no work was done

### Week 2 (21 Sep - 25 Sep)

This week we interviewed the workshop technicians in the workshop w1218. We interviewed Mr Ang Boon Thiam and Mr Edward. Mr Edward said that he does not find the fastener dispenser useful as he prefers to just take the fasteners manually as it is faster. Mr Ang also did not really find the fastener dispenser useful, coming from the perspective of the workshop technicians as they do not really need such a machine.They do not really work on assembly drawings and thus do not find much use on the special feature our original idea for the dispenser which is to to be able to scan a standard part list for fasteners and dispensing all in one go. He however suggested that we make a fastener sorter instead as he actually has a box full of mixed up fasteners.

Our group did further research on the fastener dispensers. We realised that such a system is rare. Rare as in multiple fasteners dispenser systems.The machines we saw could only dispense a single type of fastener. We realised that having a multiple fastener dispensing system is not practical as it would eat up huge space as the mechanical components to dispense each fastener is complex.This would also mean a limited fastener types.In conclusion, we realised that the fastener sorter is the logical idea to pursue as it is something that will be useful to the workshop and will not take up a lot of space.

For fastener sorters, we wanted to make one suited for the given box, which was a mix of different fasteners of different sizes. We researched existing products and products that had a function of sorting. Most of the machines have a limited sorting capability, for example, they sort only 1 type of fastener of different sizes.The one below can seperate by different thread size, but have the same head.It is important to note that the box of fasteners Mr Ang showed us has male parts of differing heads.

Current existing fastener sorters in the market are quite expensive and large.The machines are technologically complex, for example using complex object recognition technology by means of precision cameras to measure and identify thread diameters and the head shape of the fasteners.Our teams do not have any prior experience in this.

Our team decided that we want to make a fastener sorter that is inexpensive and compact. To do this, we will incorporate existing low technology ideas to seperate the male and female parts.To further seperate the male parts of different threads, we plan to use laser rangefinder technology to measure and identify the threads based on different distances.Below is a link to our idea we trying to in corporate

Tze Pin researched on the electrical components……..

### Week 3 (28 Sep - 2 Oct)

This week we measured the fasteners in the box and created concept sketches. We measured the outer diameter and thread diameter of a handful of male fasteners.We wanted to find out what are the sizes of the fasteners in the box so that we know the dimensions to use when designing the fastener sorter. We put inserted the values in microsoft excel to visualise the frequency of the type of fasteners.Below you can see the 3 distinct colours shades indicating the 3 distinct ranges of outer diameter of the male fasteners

<img src="https://github.com/QATPR/QATPR.github.io/blob/main/imagesTeam/MaleMeasure1.PNG" width ="300"><img src="https://github.com/QATPR/QATPR.github.io/blob/main/imagesTeam/MaleMeasure2.PNG" width ="300"><img src="https://github.com/QATPR/QATPR.github.io/blob/main/imagesTeam/MaleMeasure3.PNG" width ="300">

Our team decided that the sorter would have two stages. The first stage is to sort the large male, small male and female parts. The second stage is to sort the male parts based on their thread diameters. From this we came up with concepts. Below is a concept for the first stage which we drew inspiration from one of our research. This method is quite a simple and low cost gravity assisted sorter, where a few walls with deviating height tolerances catches different sized male fasteners based on the outer diameter of the screws, with the thin washers being able to pass through all the walls.

<img src="https://github.com/QATPR/QATPR.github.io/blob/main/imagesTeam/Concept%201F.png" width ="300"><img src="https://github.com/QATPR/QATPR.github.io/blob/main/imagesTeam/Fastener%20Sorter%203.PNG" width ="700">

[https://youtu.be/H19S197kgXA]

We chose this because it was a simple mechanism to fabricate and we believed it would be quite precise and reliable. We further developed this concept. We realised that one of the conditions we had to work on is the speed of loading the fasteners. This is because if the fasteners entered too fast, jamming would occur. So Jeren was tasked with making the entrance for the fastener sorter. Faaris worked on the actual sorting part of the sorter, and Tze Pin worked on the vibration module of the sorter. The vibration module is required as it unjams them and helps them move as well.Below is a 3d modelled concept prototype made from acrylicic.Do note that we plan to make the final product out of aluminium and this is only a quick prototype to test for possible problems we may have missed.

<img src="https://github.com/QATPR/QATPR.github.io/blob/main/imagesFaris/Stage%202%20a.PNG" width ="500">

For the entrance, we decide to use a coil. The coil would be able to separate the fasteners into smaller groups and push them into the sorter, allowing them to enter at a slower and constant speed, leading to less jamming occurring. Additional parts required are a tube that holds the coil, covers for both sides of the tube, a box for the user to load the fasteners and something to hole the box in place. For the tube that holds the coil, we decided to use a PVC pipe. We went to a hardware shop in Clementi and bought one.

Rotation to dispense to compartments

<img src="https://github.com/QATPR/QATPR.github.io/blob/main/imagesFaris/Stage%201%20e.PNG" width ="400">

How this works:
After sorting the male and female fasteners at stage 1, the male fasteners will travel to stage 2, where they will be sorted by thread diameter. The fasteners will be lined up and travel in a sigle file line. They will then reach the revolver part, where the fasteners will be loaded one by one, as seen on the top view. The part will then rotate and arrive at the measuring area. A block will grip onto the thread using the tension of a tension band, then a laser range finder will measure the distance away from the block, then it will get the difference, allowing us to determine the thread diameter. ...


Jeren continued working on the entrance for the fasteners, he started working on CAD models for all the parts for the entrance. We thought that the entrance could work as an lift to carry the fasteners upwards as well. The loading of the fasteners were tough. A few ideas of how the fastener loading area should be were drawn.

<img src="https://github.com/QATPR/QATPR.github.io/blob/main/imagesJeren/Slope%20ideas.jpeg" width ="600">

These are the models created.

We 3D printed the cover 2.

<img src="https://github.com/QATPR/QATPR.github.io/blob/main/imagesJeren/cover1%20printed.jpeg" width ="300">

It took 2 hour 10 mins and used 33g of PLA. We tried fitting the cover onto the PVC pipe. It was tightfitted onto the pipe, but i believe that it was too tight. The next day, a small crack appeared on the cover.

After more considerations, we decided to have the entrance be horizontal. This allows us to use a smaller motor as the overall load would decrease. All the parts have been replaced or edited to be better, except the coil. These are the new parts. Another difference is that the fasteners enter the open side of the pipe instead of the curved edge of the pipe. However both the exits will be at the curved edge.

<img src="https://github.com/QATPR/QATPR.github.io/blob/main/imagesJeren/Cover1%202.0.PNG" width ="300"><img src="https://github.com/QATPR/QATPR.github.io/blob/main/imagesJeren/Cover2%202.0.PNG" width ="300"><img src="https://github.com/QATPR/QATPR.github.io/blob/main/imagesJeren/box2.PNG" width ="300"><img src="https://github.com/QATPR/QATPR.github.io/blob/main/imagesJeren/slope.PNG" width ="300"><img src="https://github.com/QATPR/QATPR.github.io/blob/main/imagesJeren/Assembly2.PNG" width ="300">

We printed the new cover 1. This time, the diameters have been increased by 1mm as the previous print was too tight.

<img src="https://github.com/QATPR/QATPR.github.io/blob/main/imagesJeren/cover1%202.0%20printed.jpeg" width ="300"><img src="https://github.com/QATPR/QATPR.github.io/blob/main/imagesJeren/cover2%202.0%20printed.jpeg" width ="300">

<img src="https://github.com/QATPR/QATPR.github.io/blob/main/imagesJeren/cover%20fitting.jpeg" width ="600">

The print failed 2 times. As there is a hole in the middle, the 3D printer drew a circle, but since the circle was too small, the circle kept moving whenever the nozzle went over it. So we changed the build plate adhesion from skirt, to raft. This allowed the circle to be connected to the raft and it didn't move anymore. This was fitted on to the PVC pipe and was just nice. This print took 2 hour 28 mins and 39g of PLA. For the second cover, a simple skirt build plate adhesion was all that was needed. This print took 2 hour 23 mins and 25g of PLA. This cover also was fitted nicely onto the PVC pipe.

For the coil, printing it is more difficult as it would require a lot of support when printing it as seen in the below image.

<img src="https://github.com/QATPR/QATPR.github.io/blob/main/imagesJeren/coil%20support.jpeg" width ="300">

This would also take about 16 hours to print. So we had to make changes so that making it would be easier.
This is the new design of the coil.

<img src="https://github.com/QATPR/QATPR.github.io/blob/main/imagesJeren/coil%20separate.PNG" width ="200">

The new design has the coil sliced in half to that the printing would reduce the amount of supports and would be easier to print. To hold the 2 parts together, the are 2 holes to insert bolts and nuts. A groove is made for a cable tie to make sure the end doesn't move. Smaller edits include make the top end a bigger diameter to make sure that area doesn't break off.
This one half of the coil printed. One edge of the coil was not printed properly, but should still be able to work. There is warping on the coil also as seen on the second image.

### Week 5 (12 Oct - 16 Oct)

Jeren continued printing the other half of the coil.

<img src="https://github.com/QATPR/QATPR.github.io/blob/main/imagesJeren/Rcoilprint.jpeg" width ="300">
<img src="https://github.com/QATPR/QATPR.github.io/blob/main/imagesJeren/coilAss.jpeg" width ="300">

This print took 3 hour 30 minutes to print and took 39g of PLA. The 2 halves of the coils are secured together by 2 3mm machine screw.

<img src="https://github.com/QATPR/QATPR.github.io/blob/main/imagesJeren/coilMisalign.jpeg" width ="300">

As seen from the image, the halves are not aligned, which is caused by shinkage. Another problem is that the warping makes it so that the worm teeth of the coil doesnt touch the other side.

<img src="https://github.com/QATPR/QATPR.github.io/blob/main/imagesJeren/warpbetween.jpeg" width ="300">

The prototype of the stage 1 of the sorting was done. The walls were tight fitted onto the main board but was "cable tie"-ed down so that we wouldnt have to use acrylic glue, allowing us to make other changes to the walls if needed.

<img src="https://github.com/QATPR/QATPR.github.io/blob/main/imagesJeren/Prototype1.jpeg" width ="300">

After testing we realised that there are many problems with the design. 
Firstly we realised that the steepness of the walls is not steep enough.The fasteners do not move down the walls fast enough, causing blockage when more fasteners are dispensed from above, jamming the whole system.
Secondly, some fasteners keeps getting jammed because the walls sometimes bends due to the vibration , randomly causing some fasteners to get stuck in between the walls. This, though, is partly due to the flexible nature of the acrylic walls.In the actual product we intend to use aluminium for the walls and board and make support structures for the board to further make the whole structure rigid.


### Week 6 (19 Oct - 23 Oct)

Our group decided that we needed to conduct an angle test of the walls to best determine which angle is best quickly displaces the fasteners to their allocated compartment to address the problems faced the previous week. Thus we came up with an aluminium angle testing board.The board have multiple holes angled in increments of 5 degrees to mount the walls for testing, along with the holes to mount the vibrator offcourse. Below is an image.

<img src="https://github.com/QATPR/QATPR.github.io/blob/main/imagesFaris/Aluminium%20Angle%20Test%20Photo.PNG" width ="500">

We decided to use the water jet to cut out our aluminium board. One thing we have to account for is to make space so that we are able to put a weight onto the aluminium piece. As a lot of water if being sprayed out, the water level in the water jet will rise causing the aluminium to float, which will make it move. So we have to put a weight on the piece. 

<img src="https://github.com/QATPR/QATPR.github.io/blob/main/imagesJeren/waterjet%20weightmove2.PNG" width ="450">

If there are holes on both sides of the piece, After cutting one part of the piece, we would then have to move the weight to the other side, allowing the water jet cut the part that was covered by the weight, allowing us to cut the entire piece while having a weight holding it down. We also have to make sure the work piece doesn't move when moving the weight.

<img src="https://github.com/QATPR/QATPR.github.io/blob/main/imagesJeren/waterjet%20nozzle.PNG" width ="200">

Another thing to keep in mind is that when the nozzle sprays the water out, it won't be straight. It will actually move away from the centre line at a small angle. Because of this, when the work piece is cut, it will not be 90° (perpendicular to the surface), but would be slanted by about 1°. However, because we would be using the piece with a thickness of only 2mm, the angle change wouldn't affect anything big.

#### Friday 

On the night prior Jeren made the drawings for the brackets.

<img src="https://github.com/QATPR/QATPR.github.io/blob/main/imagesJeren/Bracket%20Drawing.PNG" width ="400">

Faaris made the fabrication procedure for the brackets.

<img src="https://github.com/QATPR/QATPR.github.io/blob/main/imagesFaris/Fabrication%20Procedure%20Worksheet%20Wall%20Bracket.PNG" width ="300">

We also made the .dxf file for the water jetting. The .dxf file is basically just the sketch of the path we want the machine to cut (purple line).

<img src="https://github.com/QATPR/QATPR.github.io/blob/main/imagesJeren/angletestplateDXF.PNG" width ="300">
Faaris and Jeren started machining the 2 brackets. But since we only borrowed 1 milling machine, we had to share the machine. In the end we only managed to finish 1 bracket.
We passed the Angle Test Plate dxf file to Mr Sng to cut for us using the water jet. We wanted to be there but unfortunatly we had class. We went to collect the angle test plate from Mr Sng after class but because the drawing didn't have the outline of the aluminium piece. Because of the missing lines, Mr Sng could'nt figure out what orientation to put the aluminium piece. So it wasn't cut and left for the next week to continue.

### Week 7 (26 Oct - 30 Oct) Prototyping of angle test

This week our objective is to water jet cut our angle test prototype and working on stage 2 design. We feel that the stage 2 design might not be appealing as it may be too slow.Our group decided that we have to come up with new designs. Meanwhile Faaris and jeren worked on the water jet cutter and milling of the components of the angle test prototype as seen in the pictures in week 6, which inlcude the base plate, brackets and walls.

#### Monday

Faaris and Jeren then started designing and drawing the new stage 2 design.

Tze Pin continued working on the rasberry pie.

Tze pin was unable to get the motors working and went to research other programs.

#### Tuesday

Faaris and Jeren finished machining out the brackets for the angle test. It was done by milling.

<img src="https://github.com/QATPR/QATPR.github.io/blob/main/imagesJeren/Machined%20brackets.jpeg" width ="300">

Below is a link to our bracket drawing and fabrication procedure as required for the fabrication.

Jeren met with Mr Sng. Mr Sng explained why the outline is important. The outline is needed because unlike a miling machine, the cutter is not solid. A milling cutter can find the edge of the piece by touching the edge of the work piece , but because the water jet uses water, it cannot touch the edge. So the outline is used to find the homing position for the machine. The reason we didn't include the outline in the first place was because we believed that since the water jet would cut the places with the line, and didn't need the jet to cut the edge of the work piece, and didn't think of the homing position.

<img src="https://github.com/QATPR/QATPR.github.io/blob/main/imagesJeren/Waterjet%20Homing.PNG" width ="400">

Mr Sng informed us that the next day he would be free to help us with the water jet. So we made the necessary changes. The .dxf now included the outline of the aluminium piece. 

<img src="https://github.com/QATPR/QATPR.github.io/blob/main/imagesJeren/angletestplatedxfUpdate.PNG" width ="300">

Jeren also made the drawing of the Angle Test plate for Mr Sng to reference to.

<img src="https://github.com/QATPR/QATPR.github.io/blob/main/imagesJeren/Angle%20test%20plate%20drawing.PNG" width ="300">

Jeren came up with an idea for stage 2. However, because the tolerance is pretty small, theres a high chance for it to get jammed.

<img src="https://github.com/QATPR/QATPR.github.io/blob/main/imagesJeren/S2ideation%2C.jpeg" width ="300">

Faaris then came up with an idea . Its basically like a vernier calliper. The bolts and screw enter a wheel like from Jeren's idea then at one side, a mechanism measures the thread diameter of the fastener. It measures the thread when the fastener passes a wheel, which get push back. The distance pushed back is then measured, like a vernier calliper. After measureing the thread, a programme decides where the fastener ends up according to the measured value.

**idea drawing**

Jeren then started modelling the wheel.

<img src="https://github.com/QATPR/QATPR.github.io/blob/main/imagesJeren/S2wheel1.PNG" width ="300">

#### Wednesday

Today we machined out the angle test prototype using the water jet cutter. We met with Mr Sng in the afternoon to discuss the fabrication. A problem surfaced. Because of the homing of the water jet, the aluminium piece actually has to be bigger than what we wanted to cut out. So we had to make the angle test plate smaller by 10mm on each side, making it 415 x 400 mm. Most of the holes had to be moved as well. After showing Mr Sng the new drawing, we proceeded to cut. 

Later on at night we did the following:

Jeren did the drawings for both the test walls

<img src="https://github.com/QATPR/QATPR.github.io/blob/main/imagesJeren/Test%20Wall%206mm.PNG" width ="400">

Faaris did the fabrication procedure for both the test walls

#### Thursday

Today, we fabricated the test walls according to the fabrication procedures and drawings. After fabricating them, we assembled the Angle Test. We realised that some of the fastneres are still getting jammed. This is most likely becaust the angle test plate and test wall were not as sturdy as we thought and could bend, allowing some fasteners to sometimes randomly be ablt to go under the test wall and get jammed. At this point no matter the angle we set the walls to, the fasteners will always be prone to jamming.

#### Friday

#### Conclusion

This week we realised that our current stage 1 idea is not good and need redesigning.Thus, next week we will need to come up with a new design for the stage 1 idea based on the things we have learnt. We need to come up with a design that is fail proof. 

### Week 7 (2 Nov - 6 Nov) Redesign of stage 1 and stage 2

#### Monday

Today we stayed at home. 

Faaris worked on the stage 1 re-design

Jeren started on modelling stage 2.
#### Tuesday
 
Faaris:
Today Faaris worked further on the stage 1 design while Jeren worked on the stage 2 design. Due to technical difficulties, we decided to revert to arduino because we face difficulties and we were taking too long.

Jeren:
Jeren worked on the wheel for measuring the screw thread diameter. Below is the assembly of it.
